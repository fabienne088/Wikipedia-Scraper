# Description
In this project we will query an API to obtain a list of countries and their past political leaders. We then extract and sanitize their short bio from Wikipedia. Finally, we save the data to disk.

Create a scraper that builds a JSON file with the political leaders of each country you get from [this API](https://country-leaders.onrender.com/docs).

Include in this file the first paragraph of the Wikipedia page of these leaders (you'll retrieve the Wikipedia page URL from the API, which you then have to scrape yourself).

## Must-have features
- You should have a working main.py script that calls the API and creates a JSON file.
- Create your own exception to include proper exception handling.
- Have a nice README with crystal-clear installation and execution instructions.
